# Digit-Recognition-with-Logistic-Regression-A-Machine-Learning-Project-using-the-MNIST-Dataset  


**Description:**  

This GitHub repository houses a comprehensive machine learning project focused on digit recognition using the popular MNIST dataset. Leveraging the scikit-learn library, specifically the Logistic Regression algorithm, this project demonstrates the steps involved in training a model to distinguish the digit '2' from other digits in the dataset. The code includes data loading, exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation through cross-validation. The project serves as an educational resource for understanding the application of logistic regression in a binary classification task, providing a foundation for exploring more advanced techniques in the field of machine learning. Explore the code, visualize the digit recognition process, and gain insights into the world of image classification with this hands-on project.
